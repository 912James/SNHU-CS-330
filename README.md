How do I approach designing software?

*What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?*

        Prior to this course, I did not have any experience with 3D graphics or OPENGL. Every week I was introduced to a new concept which laid the foundation for the project. Learning how to create 2D shapes and then turning them into 3D shapes using vectors and matrices, learning how to position and move the cameras, and finally adding lighting and texture. Every one of those concepts helped me craft my project but also gain a basic undersatnding of 3D graphics. 
        
*What design process did you follow for your project work?*

        Taking the iteration approach where I was able to improve the skills learned from the previous modules/weeks when new conncepts were introduced was how i was able to take my design from a basic cylinder to the finished project. Every week the previous concepts became easier adn easier to understand and to implement into the finished project. 
        
*How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?*

        I really enjoyed the iteration approach where we learned the basics of one concept and had an assignment and a milestone which required us to code the new skills. With the milestones those new skills that were being learned took the basic 2D project proposal to a finished 3d scene in a couple weeks. Those tactics of learning one skill and then building onto it will be beneficial in both my continued education but also when i go intot he field.

How do I approach developing programs?

*What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?*

        At first I was lost on how to utilize the concepts being introduced into my 3D scene. Once the professor explained what he was looking for i was able to change my approach, in which case i started to use the weekly assignements to study how the concepts worked and then applied them to the 3D scene. After taking a couple hours off or the night i came back to the project with new ideas to try, which ultimately kept helping me both improve my understanding for 3D graphics but also coding in general. Making changes in one section of code, made other functions and objects work differently, which is where i spent most of time, tinkering around with the code trying to learn how everything worked. 
        
*How did iteration factor into your development?*

       Iteration developement was my favorite way of building a project. Learning a new concpet weekly and having time to study and implemenet that new skill into both an assignement and the milestone was the most beneficial way of learning for me personally. Having the tutorials but more importantly a hands on professor who is readily available to answer any questions made the process of learning every week so much easier. While the course is on the difficult side, the avaialbke resources made the class enjoyable, especially once the 3D scene was finished.
       
*How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?*

        For me like I mentioned previosuly, this course helped me tremendously in learning how the code worked within each assignement and project. I spent a lot of time tinkering around with the code, trying to understand how one aspects affects the other and then tying it all together. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

*How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?*

        Coming into the course I did not have any knowledge of how graphics and visualizations worked, while having a major interest in how video games and movies that utilized graphics and visualizzations were created. It shows the amount of work and dedication a team has when creating projects which makes them more impressive after learning the basics. In my future educational learning i will transition into software engineering so I am not sure how directly graphics and visualizations will be applied into those courses but I am grateful that all the troubleshooting and behind the scenes work I did in the code during this semester will help my with my remaining courses.
